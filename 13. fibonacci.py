# Desc: Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and then generates them.
#       Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.
#       (Hint: The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where
#       the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence.
#       The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)

# Returns the nth fibonacci number

        return 0
    if n == 1:
